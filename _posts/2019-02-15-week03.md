# Enhanced Knowledge

Personally, I feel that I must increase my knowledge on larger scale systems and server side technologies. Java contains not only a large amount of libraries, but extensive amount of frameworks, and extensions of the Java SE such as the Java EE. Learning and contributing to such projects, will give me not only a full and extensive knowledge of the java language, but it will make me a valuable contributer to open source projects and a valuable software engineer. My first stop will be extending my QA knowledge using Junit and Mockito and contributing to projects that needs those.
