# Open Source Selection
<br>
When considering my strengths and weaknesses, I feel that the most important thing to me is strengthening my java skills. My goal is to become a backend developer in the industry field, and I believe that what is most vital for me is strengthening my construction of business logic in various applictions, with the industry most widely used programming language. I orignially thought of contributing to the OpenSource NYC project and do my part in developing the infrastructure and business logic in the backend, but now after the Mozilla presentation by Mr. Bacharakis, and looking through the projects in Mozilla's opensource web source website, I decided to do somthing a bit different. I decided to contribute to Apache Cassandra which is a distributed database developed by facebook as a solution to solving big data problems with Shane, Eli, and Roy. Not only will this project  enhance my java skills, and  working with other frameworks, and it will give me a better understanding with working with large scale applications to solve industries problems. As part of the team my goal will be understanding the application, and doing my part in either possibly enhancing the application or solving issues.
