# Issues I can fix

<br>
For the apache cassandra there is not a tab for issues however there is a tab and option for pull requests. My first thing will most likely be commenting on these pull requests and why they cannot be merged wih the original repository- which is possibly due to merge conflicts, or leave a comment in the discussion for these pull requests. Otherwise, I will create a pull requests on my own. 

### These are the pull requests that I will analyze: 

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/295

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/293

https://github.com/apache/cassandra/pull/275
