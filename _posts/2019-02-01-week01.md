# Open source vs Free Software

I believe that the underlying the factor that distinguishes these two types of public software projects is that for free software there are less consequeces and is more towards the literal definition of the word "freedom" in preference to redistribution of the program itself. If you see the rules regarding open source software there are several rules regarding how the code should be modified, how the license should be constructed, how the program should be redistributed, and what should be contained in the program itself, etc. Similar to how US allows "free speech" but there are definitely limitations when it comes to the law. However for free software, it is geared more towards having the client/user using the software in any form without limitating the circumstances of how it should be used.
    
# Open Street Map

For this open source project, I labeled places that had significant impact during my childhood/teenage years and felt that it should be at least recognized in some form - my music school, my music camp, my first job, my elementary school, and my home town in Haiti.
