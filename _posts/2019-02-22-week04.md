## Making Project Evaluation WorkSheets
<br>
  Doing the project evaluation was somewhat complicated for me. It involved doing more research
  than what I had thought what was intended. I had positives and negatives doing the evaluations. The positives were 
  that I began to be more knowledgable and appreciate the tools available in github - such as the issues, bugs, and code 
  evaluations. The negatives were that not all the information was there, I had to use outside resources to get a hollistic view.
  Questions such as number of total collabrators over a period of time, complete total number frameworks and 
  different types of code uses were tricky to find. Furthermore documentations were a bit vague and not geared towards junior developer.
  OverallI thought it was a good learning experience.
