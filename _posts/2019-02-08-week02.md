# First Contributions

I would like to contribute to resources regarding interview preparation. There has been several resources and questions that I have found to be helpful in my software engineering interviews that I believe not many students know about. If anything, it would be nice to contribute an to in-depth repository for students to look to for guidance on questions commonly asked for coding interviews.


# Ideal Projects

Contributing to a game or game engine would sound pretty exciting. It would give me the opportunity to work and learn on a range of topics for my career specialty, backend engineering. I will have the chance to work and contribute to large scale applications, enhance my distributed programming skills, learn cloud computing, and engance my business logic.
