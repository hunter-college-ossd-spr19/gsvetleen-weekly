## Progress for Cassandra Open Source

We finally got the team together! Shane, Eli, I have started to organize our tasks and come together regarding our parts in contributing to the cassandra project. For now, I am organizing our get togethers. We've organized weekly meetups in order for us to stay on track on our contributions, Wednesday around 7pm. For now we are still reseraching other pull requests and finding our place on where we can contribute in regards of documentation. Furthermore, We are are looking at a large amount of source code. We have started in looking from a higher end perspective in analyzing the source code. This way we will be more effcient and precise in our documentation.
